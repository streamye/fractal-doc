Self Testnet
-----------------------------------------
Welcome to fractal-docs's documentation for building an **self-testnet** environment.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Notes**:
''''''''''
By self-testnet ,we mean only the nodes started by yourself are in this environment.
You can allocate stakes(or account balance) for yourself,whereas in **main-testnet**
environment you need to request stakes from ``fractal-account``.

This is the Wiki for the official fractal **start-node**, **account-management** , **transaction** and **smart-contract**.
Considering a typical user's ``basic-use-path``: a typical user may want to : ``start a node`` -> ``generate account`` -> ``send transaction`` -> ``lookup balance``.
Then he(or she) needs to look through `start-node <start_node>`_, `transaction.1 <transaction>`_ , `account-management.3  <account_management>`_ .
Another typical scene is ``deploy-smart-contract`` which is not expanded here, you can lookup `smart contract <smart_contract>`_.
Remind yourself that the four chapters maybe partially coincident , for example: you must ``generate account`` when you ``start-node``,and ``generate account``
is actually included in account-management.

start-node includes ``four`` steps , click details `here <start_node.html>`_:

1. download files .

2. generate account .

3. generate allocation file .

4. start node .


account-management includes ``three`` steps, click details `here <account_management.html>`_:

1. generate account .

2. list account .

3. lookup balance .


transaction includes ``one`` step, click details `here <transaction.html>`_:

1. send transaction.
