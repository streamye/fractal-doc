Self Testnet
-----------------------------------------
Welcome to fractal-docs's documentation for building an **self-testnet** environment.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Notes**:
''''''''''
By self-testnet ,we mean only the nodes started by yourself are in this environment.
You can allocate stakes(or account balance) for yourself,whereas in **main-testnet**
environment you need to request stakes from ``fractal-account``.

This is the Wiki for the official fractal **start-Node**, **account-management** , **transaction** and **smart-contract**.
Considering a typical user's ``basic-use-path``: a typical user may want to : ``start a node`` -> ``generate account`` -> ``send transaction`` -> ``lookup balance``.
Then he(or she) needs to look through `start-node <start_node>`_, `transaction.1 <transaction>`_ , `account-management.3  <account_management>`_ .
Another typical scene is deploy-smart-contract which is not expanded here, you can lookup `smart contract <smart_contract>`_.
Remind yourself that they maybe Partially coincident such as: you must generate account when you ``Starting-Node``,and generate account
is actually included in Account-Management.

Starting-Node includes ``four`` steps ,click details `here <start_node>`_:

1. download files .

2. generate account.

3. generate allocation file .

4. start node .


Account-Management includes ``four`` steps,click details `here <account_management>`_:

1. generate account .

2. list account .

3. lookup balance .

4. lookup storage .


Transaction includes ``one`` step,click details `here <transaction>`_:

1. send transaction.
