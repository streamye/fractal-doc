Main Testnet
-----------------------------------------
Welcome to fractal-docs's documentation for building an **alone-testnet** environment.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Notes**:
''''''''''
By alone-testnet ,we mean only the nodes started by yourself are in this environment.
You can allocate stakes(or account balance) for yourself,whereas in **standord-testnet**
environment you need to request stakes from fractal-account;you can start nodes alone without
connectting to **standord-testnet**.

This is the Wiki for the official fractal Starting-Node,Account-Management, Transaction and Smart-Contract.
Considering a typical user's basic use-path:a typical user may want to start a node -> generate account -> send transaction -> lookup balance.
A typical user need to look through Starting-Node,Transaction.1,Account-Management.3 .
Another typical scene is deploy-smart-contract which is not expanded here, you can lookup `smart contract <smart_contract>`_.
Remind yourself that they maybe Partially coincident such as: you must generate account when you ``Starting-Node``,and generate account
is actually included in Account-Management.

Starting-Node includes ``four`` steps ,click details `here <start_node>`_:

1. download files .

2. generate account.

3. generate allocation file .

4. start node .


Account-Management includes ``four`` steps,click details `here <account_management>`_:

1. generate account .

2. list account .

3. lookup balance .

4. lookup storage .


Transaction includes ``one`` step,click details `here <transaction>`_:

1. send transaction.
