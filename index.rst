Welcome to fractal-docs's documentation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the Wiki for the official fractal start-node, accounts-management and transactions. Mining is included in start-node.


You must be curious about **how to get started**. In fact, there are **two** ways of **Getting started**. **First One**: ``self-testnet`` it means playing around all by yourself
**Second One**: ``main-testnet`` it means startting nodes to play around with other guys,mainly fractal nodes.
The main difference is that you have to get balance from ``main-testnet`` if you want to start-mining, while in ``self-testnet`` you can allocate balance for yourself.
For simple use, you can just start a ``self-testnet`` as starter.After building ``self-testnet``,building  ``main-testnet`` will be very simple.
