Welcome to fractal-docs's documentation!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is the Wiki for the official fractal start-node, Accounts and transactions.Mining is included in start-node.
You can play around all by yourself(we call self-testnet) or connect to main-testnet to play around with other guys.
The main difference is that you have to get balance from main-testnet if you want to start-mining,for simple use, one 
can just start a self-testnet as starter.

Main entry points:
