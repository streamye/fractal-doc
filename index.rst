Welcome to Fractal-Deployment's documentation!

Introduction
==============

Welcome to The Fractal Deployment Doc, a deployment introductory about Fractal. 
The Fractal Chain helps you write commercial-scale DApps,
it provides secure scalability solutions to handle 1,000x more transactions than legacy blockchain as well as near-instant finality.

Who Deployment Doc Is For
---------------------------
This Doc is for those who want to start fractal node for mining, do some tests such as : deploying a smart contract, managing accounts and 
send transactions.


How to Use this Doc
--------------------
In general, this Doc assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to back. 
Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not
delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter.

You’ll find three chapters in this Doc:

- `Getting Started <guides/gettting_started.html>`_  explains how to install Fractal , how to Get Your First Block and more about how to use script file ``start_private.sh``. Here we provide ``Private-Network`` and ``TestNetwork`` for you to start.

- `How To Guides <guides/how_to_guide.html>`_ is a detailed hands-on introduction to start node, it is more flexible than `Getting Started <guides/gettting_started.html>`_. Here we list steps , and later chapter 3 will provide additional details. 

- `Usage <guides/usage.html>`_ is usage description of every command in detail.
